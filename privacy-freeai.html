        <h2>Privacy Policy - Neural AI</h2>
        <p class="last-updated"><em>Last updated: 10th April, 2025</em></p>

        <section>
            <h3>Finally, AI That Respects Your Privacy.</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Neural AI. This app is designed with privacy as its core principle. We believe you should have access to powerful AI tools without compromising your personal data. This policy explains how Neural AI handles data â€“ or rather, how it *doesn't*.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Data We Do NOT Collect</h3>
            <p><strong>Neural AI operates 100% on your device.</strong> We do not collect, store, transmit, or process *any* of the following personal data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your chat conversations or prompts.</li>
                <li>The content of your notes processed by the AI-Powered Notes feature (raw, structured, or dictated).</li>
                <li>Your reminders or tasks created with Smart Reminders.</li>
                <li>Data accessed for the Daily Digest (e.g., calendar event details, reminder content) beyond the temporary on-device processing needed to generate the summary.</li>
                <li>Audio recordings from dictation.</li>
                <li>Your location data.</li>
                <li>Your contacts or calendar information.</li>
                <li>Personal identifiers (name, email, device ID, etc.).</li>
                <li>Usage analytics that could identify you or your specific interactions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Everything happens locally on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Data Processed On-Device</h3>
            <p>The app processes the following data locally on your device to provide its features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Text Input:</strong> Your typed prompts, chat messages, and content for AI-Powered Notes are processed by the local AI model you have installed.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio Input (Dictation):</strong> If you use dictation, your voice is processed locally by Apple's Speech Recognition framework (or the on-device model, if applicable) to convert it to text.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Reminder Content:</strong> The text and timing information you provide for reminders are processed locally to understand the task and schedule notifications using Apple's UserNotifications framework.</li>
                <li><strong>Daily Digest Data:</strong> If you enable the Daily Digest, the app locally accesses your selected calendar events and reminder data for the specified period (day, week, month) solely to generate the summary. This data is processed on-device and is not stored or transmitted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This processing occurs entirely within the secure environment of your device. No data is sent to external servers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Permissions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microphone Access:</strong> Required only if you choose to use the dictation feature (e.g., for notes, reminders, or chat). Audio is processed locally.</li>
                <li><strong>Speech Recognition Access:</strong> Required only if you choose to use dictation. Recognition happens locally.</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Required only if you want Smart Reminders to send you reminder alerts.</li>
                <li><strong>Calendar Access:</strong> Required only if you choose to enable the Daily Digest feature to allow the app to read event data for summarization. This data is only processed locally.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can manage these permissions in your device's Settings.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Data Storage</h3>
            <p>Your chats, notes created with AI-Powered Notes, and reminders created with Smart Reminders are stored locally on your device using Apple's secure Core Data framework. Any settings related to the Daily Digest are also stored locally. This data is included in your standard device backups (iCloud or iTunes/Finder) if you have those enabled, but it is not accessible to us.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>Neural AI does not knowingly collect any data from users, including children under 13.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy if future features require changes in data handling, although our core commitment to on-device processing and privacy will remain. We will notify you of significant changes by updating this policy within the app or on our website.</p>
        </section>
